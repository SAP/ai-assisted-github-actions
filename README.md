# AI-Assisted GitHub Actions

_Automate your PR workflow with GitHub Actions powered by SAP AI Core. Get instant summaries and reviews—no more manual grunt work._

Hey rudeGPT, review my Pull Request for “AI-assisted GitHub Actions”!

> Using AI to automate PR reviews, huh? Sounds like a bunch of nerds got tired of doing their jobs and decided to make a robot do it. But hey, if it works, it works. Just don't come crying to me when Skynet takes over and your precious AI starts rejecting all your PRs...

## Available Actions

The following GitHub Actions are available to assist with pull requests:

- **[Pull Request Summary](pr-summary)**  
  This action calls SAP AI Core to create a comment with a summary of the pull request.  
  Usage: `SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3`
- **[Pull Request Review](pr-review)**  
  This action calls SAP AI Core to create a review of the pull request (as comment).  
  Usage: `SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-review@v3`

These actions access [models available via _SAP AI Core Orchestration_ service](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/model-configuration).

## Requirements and Setup

To get started, you'll need to configure both _GitHub Actions_ and _SAP AI Core_.

1.  Activate **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** for your repo

2.  Create **[SAP AI Core Deployment for Orchestration](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core)** and get your service key.

3.  Store the full service key in a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) (e.g., `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY`).

    <details>
       <summary>The service key looks like this (click to expand)</summary>

    ```json
    {
      "serviceurls": {
        "AI_API_URL": "..."
      },
      "appname": "...",
      "clientid": "...",
      "clientsecret": "...",
      "identityzone": "...",
      "identityzoneid": "...",
      "url": "..."
    }
    ```

    </details>

4.  Create a [workflow file](https://docs.github.com/de/actions/get-started/quickstart) in your repository with a workflow configuration that uses this action.

## Usage

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file e.g., `.github/workflows/ai-assistance.yml`, with the following content:

```yaml
name: AI-assisted
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ready_for_review]

jobs:
  summary:
    name: PR Summary
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
        with:
          aicore-service-key: ${{ secrets.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY }}
          model: gpt-4o
          exclude-files: package-lock.json
  review:
    name: PR Review
    runs-on: [ubuntu-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-review@v3
        with:
          aicore-service-key: ${{ secrets.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY }}
          model: gpt-4o
          exclude-files: package-lock.json
```

This action will be executed when a
[pull request review is ready for review](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request). It will create a
summary of the pull request as a comment as well as a pull request review.

- The `aicore-service-key` should be a valid service key for your _SAP AI Core_ service instance.
