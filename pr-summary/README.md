# AI-Assisted GitHub Actions for Pull-Request Summaries

_Boost your workflow with AI-generated, concise pull request summaries. Save time and enhance team collaboration directly within GitHub._

This GitHub Action will generate an AI-created summary of a pull request, providing an overview of the changes and key points.
Please be aware that any summaries generated by the AI should be considered as informative guidance and not definitive conclusions.

### How It Works

1. The action captures the diff (added, removed, and modified content) of a pull request.
2. This diff is sent to the _SAP AI Core_ service, which employs a [generative AI model](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/model-configuration) to create a summary.
3. The summary is then posted as a comment in the pull request.

## Requirements and Setup

To get started, you'll need to configure both _GitHub Actions_ and _SAP AI Core_.

1.  Activate **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** for your repo

2.  Create **[SAP AI Core Deployment for Orchestration](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core)** and get your service key.

3.  Store the full service key in a [GitHub secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) (e.g., `AICORE_SERVICE_KEY`).

    <details>
       <summary>The service key looks like this (click to expand)</summary>

    ```json
    {
      "serviceurls": {
        "AI_API_URL": "..."
      },
      "appname": "...",
      "clientid": "...",
      "clientsecret": "...",
      "identityzone": "...",
      "identityzoneid": "...",
      "url": "..."
    }
    ```

    </details>

4.  Create a [workflow file](https://docs.github.com/de/actions/get-started/quickstart) in your repository with a workflow configuration that uses this action.

## Usage

To include this action in a workflow, use the following syntax:

```yaml
uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
```

The action is available in these GitHub Enterprise Server instances:

- github.tools.sap
- github.wdf.sap.corp
- github.concur.com

### Minimal Example

Create a file `.github/workflows/ai-assistance.yml` with the content below:

```yaml
name: AI-assisted
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ready_for_review]

jobs:
  summary:
    name: PR Summary
    runs-on: [solinas]
    steps:
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
        with:
          aicore-service-key: ${{ secrets.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY }}
```

This example triggers the action when a pull request transitions from _draft_ to _ready for review_.

> **Note**: Here, the workflow trigger event is `ready_for_review` needs an explicit status transition from _draft_ to _ready to review_ in a PR. Just creating a PR (which is already in _ready-to-review_ status) won't be enough to trigger the workflow.
>
> If you click on _convert to draft_ and then click _ready to review_, the workflow should be triggered. Alternatively, you could use a different trigger that [looks for a specific user that is requested for a review](#review-requested-for-specific-user).

It will create a summary of the pull request as a comment. Please be aware that any summaries generated by the AI should be considered as informative guidance and not definitive conclusions.

- The `aicore-service-key` should be a valid service key for your _SAP AI Core_ service instance.
- Since no `user-token` is provided, the action will use the default GitHub token (usually the _github-actions[bot]_ user).

Output parameters of the action:

| Parameter     | Description                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `summary`     | The AI-generated summary (Markdown format)                          |
| `displayText` | Contains the header, summary, and footer text.                      |

## Advanced Examples

### Trigger on review request

Execute the action when a [pull request review is requested](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) for a specific user:

```yaml
name: AI-assisted
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [review_requested]

jobs:
  review:
    name: PR Review
    if: github.event.requested_reviewer.login == 'my-orgs-serviceuser'
    runs-on: [solinas]
    steps:
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
        with:
          user-token: ${{ secrets.MY_ORGS_SERVICE_USER_TOKEN }}
          aicore-service-key: ${{ secrets.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY }}
```

- The `if` condition is used to filter the review requests to a specific user (e.g., `my-orgs-serviceuser`).
- The `user-token` is the [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) of the user who will create the comment and should match the user token of the user specified in the `if` condition.
- The `aicore-service-key` should be a valid service key for your _SAP AI Core_ service instance.

### Exclude/Include Specific Files

#### Exclude certain files of the PR from the summary:

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    exclude-files: package-lock.json, *-lock.json
```

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    exclude-files: |
      package-lock.json
      *-lock.json
```

- The pattern provided in `exclude-files` excludes all files with `package-lock.json` and `*-lock.json` in the name.

#### Include only specific files of the PR in the summary:

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    include-files: "**/*.ts, **/*.js"
```

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    include-files: |
      **/*.ts
      **/*.js
```

- The pattern provided in `include-files` includes all files with `.ts` and `.js` extensions.

### Exclude Specific Actors

Prevent the action from being triggered by specific actors like bots:

```yaml
jobs:
  summary:
    name: PR Summary
    if: github.actor != 'ospo-renovate[bot]'
    runs-on: [solinas]
    steps:
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
        with:
```

- The `if` [condition](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/using-conditions-to-control-job-execution) makes sure the step only runs if it's not started by the [`ospo-renovate[bot]`](https://github.tools.sap/github-apps/ospo-renovate) user. Otherwise, the job will be marked as skipped.

### Influence the Display Mode

#### Append the summary to the PR description instead of posting it as a comment:

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    display-mode: append
    header-text: "## AI Summary\n"
    footer-text: "\n---\n"
```

- The `display-mode` parameter is set to `append` to add the summary to the PR description.
- The `header-text` parameter is set to a markdown header to distinguish the summary from the default PR text.
- The `footer-text` parameter is set to a markdown horizontal rule to separate the summary from the default PR text.

#### Utilize output for further actions

```yaml
jobs:
  summary-and-review:
    name: PR Summary & Review
    runs-on: [solinas]
    steps:
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
        id: summary
        with:
          aicore-service-key: ${{ secrets.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY }}
          display-mode: none
      - uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-review@v3
        with:
          aicore-service-key: ${{ secrets.AICORE_SERVICE_KEY }}
          header-text: |
            ## AI Summary
            ${{ steps.summary.outputs.displayText }}
            ---
```

- The `display-mode` parameter is set to `none` to prevent the summary from being displayed as a comment.
- The `displayText` output parameter is used to pass the summary to the next action for further processing.

### Custom AI Model or Prompt

#### Specify a custom AI model:

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    model: anthropic--claude-3.5-sonnet
```

- The `model` parameter can be set to the executable ID of the [available generative AI models](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766/E).

#### Extend or customize the prompt:

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    prompt-addition: |
      At the end of the summary, include a whimsical, short poem to celebrate the changes. Feel free to use emojis where relevant.
```

- The `prompt-addition` parameter can be set to a custom prompt that will be appended to the base prompt.

#### Create a fully custom prompt:

```yaml
- uses: SAP/ai-assisted-github-actions/pr-summary@v3
  with:
    prompt: |
      Create a summary of the pull request. 
      Include the changes, the reason for the changes, and the impact of the changes.
```

- The `prompt` parameter can be set to a custom prompt that will be used to generate the summary.
